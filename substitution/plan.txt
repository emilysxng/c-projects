1) MAKE FUNCTION WHICH GETS KEY FROM CMD LINE ARG
    return 0 if there is an input
    return 1 if there is nothing/more than 1 argumentdebug50     ggsdfgsdgsdg & print error message (remind user of how to use: Usage: ./substitution key)

2) VALIDATE KEYS AND PROVIDE ERROR MESSAGES
     if key is too short/long... (make a function and have it return variable "length". make an if/else statement in the main code: if length is 26, return 0, else, return 1.)
     if key has characters other than letters... (make a function and have it return 0 or 1 into a bool variable called letters_only. make an if/else statement in the main code)
     if key has repeated characters... (make individual counters)
    print corresponding error message and prompt again****
    it can be a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters. use a for with an if loop inside to make any lowercase letter uppecase

3) GET PLAINTEXT
    get_string

4) ENCRYPT PLAINTEXT
    only supports uppercase and lowercase letters (no numbers, spaces, or punctuation)
    uppercase must remain uppercase. lowercase must remain lowercase.

    array for the key:
        char key[52];
        key[0] = first character of key
        key[1] = second character of key
        ....
        key[26] = first character of key + 32
        key[51] = last character of key + 32
                                     for loop to fill in the array:
                                            int y = 0;
                                            for (int x = 26; x < 52; x++)
                                            {
                                                key[x] = key[y] + 32;
                                                y++;
                                            }
                                    // makes a lowercase version of uppercase letters

5) PRINT CIPHERTEXT
    printf
