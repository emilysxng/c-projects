*** The only code that I wrote is helpers.c

HOW TO RUN: ./filter [-g, -s, -r, or -b] images/[input.bmp] [output.bmp]




GRAYSCALE:
For each pixel, (make 2 for loops)
	- find avg of the R, G, and B values.
	- Round it to the nearest integer.
	- Set and R, G, and B values to that average.

	to run:
	./filter -g infile.bmp outfile.bmp
	
SEPIA:
For each pixel, (make 2 for loops),
	- calculate new sepia R, G, and B with their formulas
	- round to the nearest integer
	- cap at 255 (if sepiaRed > 255, then sepiaRed = 255)

  sepiaRed = .393 * originalRed + .769 * originalGreen + .189 * originalBlue
  sepiaGreen = .349 * originalRed + .686 * originalGreen + .168 * originalBlue
  sepiaBlue = .272 * originalRed + .534 * originalGreen + .131 * originalBlue

make temp into an array and then instead of 3 if conditions, make 1 for loop which indexes into the array
