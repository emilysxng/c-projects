Complete the vote function.
    "vote" takes a string called name, the name of the candidate who was voted for.

    If name matches one of the names of the candidates, then update that candidateâ€™s vote total to account for the new vote.
    The vote function in this case should return true to indicate this.

    If name does not match the name of any of the candidates in the election, no vote totals should change.
    The vote function should return false to indicate an invalid ballot.
    
    *** You may assume that no two candidates will have the same name.

Complete the print_winner function.
    The function should print out the name of the candidate who received the most votes, and then print a newline.
    The election could end in a tie if multiple candidates have the same number of votes.
        In this case you should output the names of each of the winners, each on a separate line.
